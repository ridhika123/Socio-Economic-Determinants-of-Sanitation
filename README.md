# Socio-Economic Determinants of Sanitation

## Abstract
A country’s access to sanitation can have widespread implications on its education levels, mortality rates and overall public health. To explore the factors that drive a country’s ability to improve its access to sanitation facilities, we study the socio-economic determinants of sanitation in 112 countries for three years over a ten-year period (2005-2015). Using linear regression analysis and beta mixture models, we find that a country’s information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure, education levels, and age dependency ratio have a statistically significant impact on its access to sanitation. However, only the effect of ICT infrastructure persists over time. Using the beta mixture models, we find that there is a general movement of countries towards higher sanitation levels.

## Data
Primary data set from ND-GAIN - Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative. The database’s main statistic, the ND-GAIN Country Index uses two decades of data across 45 indicators to rank 181 countries annually based upon their vulnerability and their readiness to successfully adapt.
